* For every Plan and Task created in a job, save a copy in the Project Folder
* File name format: [job-name]-[plan/task]-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md
* Include a changelog-style log at the top of each file:
  - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: [description of change]
  - [additional changes]
* Ensure all changes are preserved and tracked chronologically (newest at top)
* Update the file whenever a Plan or Task is modified or accepted
* Use the same format for all Plan and Task logs
